### JVM languages


* Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala
* The source code will be in a different format(syntax/semantics will be different)
* But they all get compiled to .class files or bytecodes
* And executed by the JVM

### Java

* OO programming language
* Case sensitive
* Compiled programming language
* Write Java code; Compiled to an intermediate format; Executed by the runtime
* Java has its syntax borrowed from C; JavaScript and Java have lot of syntactical similarities
* Statically typed language; 
* You can implement frontend applications also using Java; Java Swing; JFX etc.
* Java is predominantly used for backend applications 

### Getting Started

* JDK -> Java Development Kit
* You can download it from **Oracle site** (OpenJDK) or (Any other JDK)
* v 22. Every 6 months there is a new release
* 1.8 is a very significant release in Java ecosystem. It brought in functional style of coding in Java
* JDK contains standard libraries; tools like compiler, runtime engine; debugger; documentation generator; decompiler
* **javac** -> java compiler
* **java** -> Java Executable engine; Java runtime environment; or JRE; JVM
* Java is Open source

### HelloWorld

* Everything you write in Java goes inside a class
* You save all the Java code in **.java** file
* Compile the class; You get a **.class** file; .class file contains **bytecodes**
* Bytecodes are executed by your JVM ( or java runtime)
* Every java application is a separate Process on its own; Look for **java** in Task Manager


### IDE

* Eclipse (Open source)
* IntelliJ IDEA (Community edition is free; Purchase Ultimate edition)
* NetBeans
* Visual Studio Code
