* Create a simple multithreaded java application (**Lab13.java**) that does the following simultaneously 

```

1) Print the current time every second 
2) Wait for user input for a number and print if the number is even or odd 
3) Every 5 seconds, connect to training db and print the list of accounts or users or persons (you can use any table of your choice; keep inserting records through MySQLWorkbench and check the output here)

```
