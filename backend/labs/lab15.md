* Use **Lab12.sql** to create database structure


#### Implement the queries to do the following

* List all accounts for a specific person given a person id
* Find persons who own a specific car model and have a checking account
* Find the total balance of saving accounts of all the senior citizens
* Find the average number of accounts per person
* Retrieve all persons, including those without accounts
* Retrieve all accounts, including those without owners (**less likely to happen in real world scenario**)

* Create a stored procedure to fetch the list of all persons (We'll learn how to invoke this from JDBC)
