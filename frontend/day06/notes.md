### JSX

* JSX is the syntax that you use to build UI in react applications
* It has an XML-like syntax
* Start tag and end tag
* If you compose more elements you need to have a root element
* JSX expressions {expression}
* Event handling; Synthetic event handling;
* camelCase notation

``` jsx
    <button onClick={eventHandlerFunctionRef}></button>
```

* So far, we have been writing react code in a single HTML file; 
* This is not how you will develop react applications. More on that later
