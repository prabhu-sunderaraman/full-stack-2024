### JavaScript (recap)

* Dynamic typed
* string, number, boolean, or objects
* let, const, var, global
* let and const are block scoped
* var is function scoped
* global scoped; _Better stay away_
* arrays -> square brackets
* usually numerical index but you can have other types as index
* for, for-in, while
* functions: _function_ keyword
* functions can be invoked even before you define
* functions can be defined any number of times with the same name; the last definition overrides the previous one
* functions can be invoked with any number of arguments
