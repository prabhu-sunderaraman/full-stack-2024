* Create a __Lab01__ component that has **countries and cities** maintained in **state**
* The countries and cities are initialized start (**Not from the backend**)
* You can use the following data for convenience.

```
India -> Pune, Chennai, Kochi
US -> NJ, NY, Houston
England -> London, Bristol, Hampshire
```

* You can design the **state of the component** the way you want!


#### Part I

* Have **two dropdown lists** in the component. 
* The first list will have the countries
* When you select a country the second dropdown list will get populated with the cities of that country.
